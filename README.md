# At a Glance

Building recommender systems, creating anomaly detection algorithms, or performing customer segmentation are all very complicated yet common tasks. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is a powerful probabilistic algorithm that can be a great tool to perform all of those tasks and more. In this guided project, you will learn how to identify complex patterns, clusters, and subgroups in your datasets by using GMMs.

GMM is a versatile unsupervised learning technique that finds applications in various domains, such as image segmentation, anomaly detection, customer behavior analysis, and so on. Throughout this project, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of GMM's underlying concepts and practical implementation techniques, equipping you with valuable skills for extracting meaningful insights from your data.

# Introduction

This project focuses on utilizing Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for building recommender systems, anomaly detection algorithms, and customer segmentation tasks. GMMs are probabilistic models that can identify complex patterns and clusters within datasets. By understanding the principles of GMMs and implementing them in Python, participants will gain valuable skills in unsupervised learning and data analysis.

# Examples

The project provides several examples to demonstrate the capabilities of GMMs:

- Recommender Systems: Building a recommender system using GMMs to recommend items to users based on their preferences and past interactions.

- Anomaly Detection: Developing an anomaly detection algorithm using GMMs to identify unusual patterns or outliers within a dataset.

- Customer Segmentation: Performing customer segmentation using GMMs to categorize customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior or demographic information.
